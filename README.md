# Board

A 2-Dimensional Array Wrapper ... and more.

# What's New?

## No More Modules
The concept of Modules are removed.

## Better Unit Testing and Code Coverage
Better unit testing principles will be adopted. The concept of code coverage will be in a future release possibly v3.1 or even v4

## No More Board Piece
This allows an even easier way of creating a board.

## Services over Modules
Services will be created over modules. Services are simply classes, which do some operation on a `Board<T>`. This allows less learning of the API to develop additional features for `Board<T>`.
