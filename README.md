# Board

A 2-Dimensional Array Wrapper ... and more.

# What's New?

1. No More Modules
	* The concept of Modules are removed.

2. Better Unit Testing and Code Coverage
	* Better unit testing principles will be adopted. The concept of code coverage will be in a future release possibly v3.1 or even v4

3. No More Board Piece
	* This allows an even easier way of creating a board.

3. Services over Modules
	* Services will be created over modules. Services are simply classes, which do some operation on a `Board<T>`. This allows less learning of the API to develop additional features for `Board<T>`.
