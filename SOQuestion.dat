I have a 2D array encapsulated in my class as follows.

	public class Test
	{
		private int h = 5;
		private int v = 5;
		privateint[][] board;
	}

where h and v are the horizontal and the vertical indices respectively.

In my Test class I have allocated my array as follows:

	public Test(int h, int v)
	{
		this.h = h;
		this.v = v;
		createArray();
	}

	private void createArray()
	{
		board = new int[h][v];

		int ctr = 0;

		for(int i = 0; i < h; i++)
		{
			for(int j = 0; j < v; j++)
			{
				board[i][j] = ctr++;
			}
		}
	}

So element at 0,0 is 0. Element at 0,1 is 1. Element at 0,2 is 2 and so on.

I want to covert `board[i][j]` to a one dimension array like such: `board1D[i*h] = new int[]';

but I am having some trouble figuring out the math for the horizontal index.
